# Team Parallax – "Embiggen Your Eyes"

We propose an interactive platform for exploring NASA’s massive image datasets. The app will let users zoom, pan, and compare high-resolution Earth, lunar, and space images across time, spectrum, and data types (e.g., optical, altimetry). Features include AI-powered search, overlays, and annotation tools for identifying and labeling features. Designed for both the public and researchers, the system will use adaptive image serving to handle large datasets efficiently. Its user-friendly interface makes it suitable for science museums as well as detailed scientific studies.
